<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In my previous work experience, I have learned to communicate well with clients, prioritize, and think about things in context.</p>
<p>I love learning new things, connecting disciplines, discussing possibilities, and discovering new tools. I always do everything to the maximum! I like to give and receive honest feedback. </p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors, spending time with my dog, skating, and teaching kids to skate.</p>
